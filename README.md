# 330Resources
A place for additional 330 resources if you are interested

Although a lot of resources exist already for CMSC330, I wanted to make my own set of worksheets for those who want a more thorough review of the material, covering things that may be overlooked or things that I find especially important.  I also want to make this a place to go for 330 fanatics who want to challenge themselves further and learn beyond the scope of the course.  I will try to balance this half and half or maybe even 75 / 25.

I believe that doing these worksheets could be very rewarding to those looking to master the course and do well.  Note: these are not mandatory, only helpful resources.

Every Friday discussion, I will aim to post a new worksheet.  I won't be posting any solutions, but you are welcome to discuss with me about it.  Additionally, if I find anything else that may be helpful, I will post it here as well.
